# libjavaserialize

A port of Java's `writeObject` method, in pure python

## Features

- serialize objects directly from python objects
- variable Access Modifiers (public, private, protected)

## Example

Work in progress

## Important:

- the code is written and tested under python 3.8+.
  - If you use MacOS+brew and upgrades regularly, you should be fine
- This project is not expected to work exactly the same as what java does, but I will do my best making `readObject` recognize what this tool spits.
